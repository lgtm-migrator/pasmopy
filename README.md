![overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasmopy/pasmopy/master/resources/images/overview.png)
-->

**Pasmopy** is a scalable toolkit for classifying cancer subtypes based on intracellular signaling dynamics generated from kinetic modeling. It is compatible with [biomass](https://github.com/okadalabipr/biomass) and offers the following features:

- Construction of mechanistic models from text
- Personalized predictions of patient outcomes
- Analysis of patient-specific pathway activities
- Cancer subtype classification based on dynamic response characteristics

### Installation

The latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
$ pip install pasmopy
```

Pasmopy requires Python 3.7+ to run.
