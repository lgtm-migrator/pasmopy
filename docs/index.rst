Pasmopy â€“ Patient-Specific Modeling in Python
=============================================

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasmopy/pasmopy/master/docs/_static/img/overview.png

**Pasmopy** is a scalable toolkit for classifying cancer subtypes based on intracellular signaling dynamics generated from kinetic modeling. It is compatible with `biomass <https://github.com/biomass-dev/biomass>`_ and offers the following features:

* Construction of mechanistic models from text
* Personalized predictions of patient outcomes
* Analysis of patient-specific pathway activities
* Cancer subtype classification based on dynamic response characteristics
